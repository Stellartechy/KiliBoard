### Project Description
Why should letters be caged when they were born to move?KiliBoard transforms ordinary typing into a fun, interactive experience with keys that bounce, glide, and move freely on your screen.
Combining smooth animations with full keyboard functionality, it makes every keystroke engaging and enjoyable.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Traditional keyboards keep keys trapped in rigid,
lifeless rows ‚Äî like birds behind iron bars. 
This confinement makes typing predictable and monotonous, 
stripping away any sense of play or creativity.
The question is: why should our keys remain silent prisoners when they could fly, bounce, and explore?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
KiliBoard rips the bars off your keyboard cage and gives every key a pair of wings.
Letters bounce, numbers glide, emojis soar ‚Äî turning every typing session into a playful chase. 
It‚Äôs not just typing, it‚Äôs a game of catching your words before they fly away.
